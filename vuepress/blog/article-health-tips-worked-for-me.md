Programming is fun and good for your brain, but is not very physically demanding and over time health can degrade - this is of course not good and we should try and maintain a balance to live longer, happier lives.

As great as Python is, “import health” unfortunately has not been created yet :man_shrugging:

I’ve made some personal changes that have shown results over the last couple of years.
You have likely heard about them but these are what have “worked for me”:

Less to 0 sugary drinks - I pretty much only drink water, coffee or tea with creamer or milk (no sugar). I do break this rule sometimes but 99% of the time drink water, and several times a day.

Standup desk (with barstool) - I used to spend most of the day/night sitting down and was getting cramps in my legs. I made diy stand up desk and added a barstool to sit when my legs got tired. This was inexpensive and made me feel better.

Exercise - I don’t go to the gym but found a 15 minute routine (it’s quite demanding) that I could do at home. I’m not a fan of spending 1-2 hours at a gym. You can do pushups, situps, jump rope or walk almost anywhere.

Diet change - this is my most recent change and has been very effective but difficult for most people. The idea is to consume 0 sugar and starches. No pasta, bread sugary deserts, potatoes or other starches but instead lots of vegetables (leafy greens) and lots of protein and “good fats” (avocado and fatty meat - bacon!!). Google low-carb-diet for more info.

Eating habits - this last one is also difficult for some people but has many (somewhat hard to believe) benefits and is becoming more popular - Intermittent Fasting (google it!). I have done this for a few months and quickly experienced visible changes (reduced waist line). The idea is to avoid eating for 14-18 hours which causes the body to consume fat (and do other good things in your body). I do this in the morning, I “keep fasting” which is basically skipping breakfast (or dinner). You need to drink lots of water when doing this and it is difficult for the first 3-4 days but after a while you really stop needing food during that time.
